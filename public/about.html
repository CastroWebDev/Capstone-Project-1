<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Fábio, and I’m a keen learner with a love for creativity and innovation. After many years of working in the dynamic world of tourism, I’ve decided to embrace a new challenge: becoming a web developer.
  With a deep appreciation for aesthetics and a knack for connecting with people, I’m excited to merge my creativity with technology to build beautiful, functional websites that deliver great user experiences. My journey into web development has been driven by my curiosity and desire to project solutions that make life simpler and more enjoyable.
  Outside of coding, you’ll find me on the tennis court, exploring the great outdoors with my family or just taking care of my garden. Nature shapes my perspective and inspire the work I do.
  I believe that my diverse background in tourism has given me an unique edge: an understanding of how to craft experiences that resonate with users and leave a lasting impression. As I continue my learning journey, I’m excited to bring that same dedication and enthusiasm to the world of web development.
  Let’s work and create something stunning together!
